multiply.pep & divide.pep:
  Given to me as a challenge by my teacher. I completed this algorithm before the class could cover it. I then set to work reversing the algorithm to create divide.pep

The problem:
  In pep8 you only have instructions for: add, subtract and bit shift (multiply/divide by 2) but no ability to multiply or divide.

My method:
  $$5 * 5 = 25
  101 * 101 = ???
  (4+1)*5 = 25 --> 4*5 =20, 	    1*5 = 5
		   100*101 = 10100  1*101=101
   10100
 +   101
  -------
   11001
$$
Now to make it generic. What if I destroyed the first number, while keeping track of the exponent. I would simply bit shift the second number that many times every time I lost data from the first number and then add it to a sum total. 
$$
  2^2 2^1 2^0 
   1   0   1 --> 
   101 * 2^0 + 101 * 2^2 = 
   101 + 10100 = 11001 
$$
Now division is simply a reversal of the algorithm... nothing is that simple though.
$$
  25 / 5 = 5
  (20 + 5)/5 --> 4+1 = 5
  11001...
$$
hmm... maybe a different algorithm was needed. I chose to mimic how we learn division. We first find a multiple of our divisor that is just smaller than our target and subtract, tallying the multiple up top before repeating. To make this work for a computer I would need to over shoot my target number and then to go back one step. So I would first bit shift the smaller number, keeping track of how many times it was shifted, until it was bigger than the first number. I then bit shifted the second number left and subtracted it.
$$
  11001 / 101
  2^0 = 101, 2^1 = 1010, 2^2 = 10100, 2^3 = 101000 > 11001	
$$
3 as an exponent is to big so we remember 2
  $11001 â€“ 10100 = 101 --> 2^2 or 4 is recorded	$	
next we backtrack until our number is less than or equal to our remainder
 $$ 2^1 = 1010 > 101
  2^0 =  101<= 101 --> 101-101=0 --> record 2^0 or 1$$
Either our exponent is at 0 or our remainder is at 0 so we stop and tally.
 $ 4+1 = 5 remainder 0$
